# Serverless/Event-Driven Architecture Design for Photo Album Application

## Overview

This project presents a serverless, event-driven architectural design for a rapidly growing photo album application using AWS cloud services. The proposed solution aims to address scalability, performance, and cost-effectiveness challenges, while minimizing in-house system administration.

### Key Components:
- **Amazon S3** for storage
- **AWS Lambda** for serverless computing
- **Amazon DynamoDB** for database management
- **AWS Step Functions** for workflow orchestration
- **Amazon Rekognition** for media processing
- **Amazon CloudFront** for global content delivery

The architecture is designed to improve global response times, support scalability, and provide a flexible foundation for future media extensions, such as video support.

## Features

- **Scalability**: The architecture automatically scales based on usage, supporting increased demand without manual intervention.
- **Serverless & Event-Driven**: Utilizes AWS Lambda, API Gateway, SQS, and Step Functions to minimize infrastructure management.
- **Global Performance**: AWS CloudFront ensures low-latency content delivery globally.
- **Cost-Effective**: The use of on-demand AWS services like Lambda and DynamoDB ensures that costs are directly proportional to usage.
- **Media Processing**: Built-in capabilities for image and video processing with automatic triggers on media upload.
- **Extensibility**: The design allows easy integration of future media formats and AI-based services.

The solution follows the **AWS 3-Tier Architecture**:
1. **Presentation Tier**: Managed by Amazon CloudFront, Route 53, and S3 for fast delivery of content.

2. **Application Tier**: Utilizes AWS Lambda for compute tasks and API Gateway for HTTP request management.

3. **Data Tier**: DynamoDB is used for scalable database management.

The design also includes a **Fan-out architecture** for media processing, ensuring efficient data distribution to various services.

## Requirements

- **AWS Account** with access to:
  - S3
  - Lambda
  - API Gateway
  - DynamoDB
  - CloudFront
  - SNS/SQS
  - Step Functions
- Familiarity with AWS services and serverless architecture principles.

## Installation

1. Set up your AWS services:
   - Create an S3 bucket
   - Set up DynamoDB tables
   - Configure API Gateway and Lambda functions
   - Set up Step Functions for media processing

2. Deploy the solution using AWS SAM or AWS CDK (or follow the manual setup in the documentation).

## Cost Estimation

The system is designed to be cost-effective and automatically scales based on usage. Estimated costs are detailed in the report based on different media upload scenarios.
